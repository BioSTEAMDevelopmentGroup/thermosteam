Thermosteam: BioSTEAM's Premier Thermodynamic Engine
====================================================

Thermosteam is a standalone thermodynamic engine capable of estimating mixture properties, solving thermodynamic phase equilibria, and modeling stoichiometric reactions. Thermosteam builds upon `chemicals <https://github.com/CalebBell/chemicals>`_, the chemical properties component of the Chemical Engineering Design Library, with a robust and flexible framework that facilitates the creation of property packages.  `The Biorefinery Simulation and Techno-Economic Analysis Modules (BioSTEAM) <https://biosteam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is dependent on thermosteam for the simulation of unit operations.

Key Features & Capabilities
---------------------------
* **Simple** and straight foward estimation of mixture properties, thermodynamic phase equilibria, and chemical reactions with just a few lines of code.

* **Clear** representation of chemical and phase data within every object using IPython's rich display system.

* **Fast** estimation of thermodynamic equilibrium within hundreds of microseconds through the smart use of cache and Numba Jit compiled functions.

* **Flexible** implemention of thermodynamic models for estimating pure component properties in just a few lines of code.

* **Extendable** framework that allows easy integration of new methods for computing thermodynamic equilibrium coefficients and mixture properties.
